## Introduction

In today's world, applications require robust backend services that can scale efficiently. The **HorizonXMicroservice** aims to provide a flexible, maintainable, and scalable architecture. By leveraging microservices, we can ensure that each component of the application can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

## Features

- **Microservice Architecture**: Each service can operate independently, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.
- **Docker Integration**: Simplifies the deployment process and ensures consistent environments.
- **ELK Stack**: Provides powerful logging and monitoring capabilities.
- **Kong API Gateway**: Manages and secures API traffic effectively.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable and robust database for data storage.
- **FastAPI Framework**: Enables quick development of APIs with automatic generation of documentation.
- **Swagger Integration**: Provides interactive API documentation.
- **Ruff for Code Quality**: Ensures that the code adheres to best practices.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Simplifies database interactions.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Elasticsearch**: For search and analytics.
- **Kibana**: For data visualization.
- **Logstash**: For log management.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **HorizonX**: Core service module.
- **Kong**: API gateway for managing microservices.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data persistence.
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend development.
- **Ruff**: A linter for Python code.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.
- **Swagger**: Tool for API documentation.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.

## Installation

To get started with the **HorizonXMicroservice**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agusmrbeast/HorizonXMicroservice.git
   cd HorizonXMicroservice
   ```

2. **Build the Docker containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:

   Ensure that PostgreSQL is running and accessible. You can configure the database settings in the `.env` file.

4. **Run the migrations**:

   Use Alembic to run the database migrations:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Access the application**:

   Once the services are running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

To interact with the API, you can use tools like Postman or curl. The API follows RESTful principles, and you can find detailed information about each endpoint in the API documentation.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger. You can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

This interface allows you to test the API endpoints directly from your browser.
